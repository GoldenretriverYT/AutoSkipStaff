# AutoSkipStaff
A Software Inc. Mod that "auto-skips" staff. I wrote "auto-skips" in quotes because that is not possible, because the game does not simulate staff when skipping time, however this mod speeds up your game way past the regular limit (30x) so you don't have to wait as long.

# Game
The game this mod is for is [Software Inc.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/362620/Software_Inc/), its great, go buy it

# Installation
Since this mod depends on Reflection, which requires the mod to ask for priviliges (as System.Reflection is blocked by default), which only works in compiled mods and those can not be uploaded to Steam Workshop, you have to manually install it.

- Download the latest release (or build it yourself)
- Open the games installation folder and go into the "DLLMods" folder (create it if it doesnt exist yet)
- Extract the zip. It should create a folder called "AutoSkipStaff" which should include a "AutoSkipStaff.dll" and "meta.tyd"
- Start the game and trust the mod. You probably have to enable it in the Mods menu too.
- If you built it yourself, ou will have to create the folder & meta.tyd yourself.

# Other stuff
This mod ignore the "Auto-skip" option in the gameplay options. If you want to fully disable it, you will have to disable this mod too.<br><br>
**This mod is made to work with Beta 1.**
